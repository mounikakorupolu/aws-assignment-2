create ec2 instances – they should be in the same subnet and have the same security group.

Open ports between them – make sure instances can communicate to each other. Use the default security group
 which has one rule relevant for this case:

Type: All Traffic
Source: Custom – id of the security group

Log in to the instance you want to connect from to the other instance

Run:
1 ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa
to generate a new rsa key.

Copy your private AWS key as ~/.ssh/my.key (or whatever name you want to use)

Make sure you change the permission to 600
1 chmod 600 .ssh/my.key

Copy the public key to the instance you wish to connect to passwordless
1 cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i ~/.ssh/my.key ubuntu@10.0.0.X "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
